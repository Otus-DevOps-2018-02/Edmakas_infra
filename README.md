###### Option 1:
Host "bastion" works as a gateway for whole hosts with no external IP address
Example of a command to connect to internal host through "bastion":

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/appuser -o ProxyCommand="ssh -i ~/.ssh/appuser -W %h:%p appuser@35.205.144.68" appuser@10.132.0.3 
```
###### Option 2:
It's convenient to use ~/.ssh/.config to simplify commands using for establishing ssh connectivity
There is an example of such configuration:
```bash
Host someinternalhost
    HostName 10.132.0.3
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/appuser
    User appuser
    ProxyCommand ssh -A bastion -W %h:%p

Host bastion
    HostName 35.205.144.68
    User appuser
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/appuser
````
#### Data for verification of OpenVpn configuration
bastion_IP = 35.205.144.68

someinternalhost_IP = 10.132.0.3
